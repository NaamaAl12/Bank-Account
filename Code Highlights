1. Object-Oriented Design
- The program demonstrates encapsulation, abstraction, and modular design through:
    - The separation of BankAccount (data model) and BankAccountClient (UI/logic).

2. Error Handling
- Includes input validation for:
    - Numeric inputs (e.g., account balance, interest rate).
    - Valid account names (letters, spaces, hyphens, and dots).
    - Prevents overdrafts or duplicate account numbers.

3. Interactive Console Application
- Uses a menu-driven approach for seamless user interaction
